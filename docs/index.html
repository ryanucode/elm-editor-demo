    <h1>Elm Editor Demos</h1>
    <p>This page contains several examples of elm not working currectly with other javascript libraries that manipulate parts of the DOM generated with Elm</p>
    <p>These pages are a trimmed down example from a current project where I am attempting to get elm rendering fullpage with some additional JS components that could (ideally) communicate with the Elm application via ports</p>
    <p>To view the error type code in the top text input. The syntax highlighted version should appear in the window below. Make sure to open your javascript console (F12 on most browsers) to see what is going on.</p>
